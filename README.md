# Goal
The goal of this project is to understand user preferences on beer to recommend the top 3 beers the user would enjoy.
Implement different recommendation systems to understand which one is the best when predicting using surprise.

# Data Collection
The Data was taken from two different beer review sites

CraftCans.com
